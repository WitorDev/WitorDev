# Witor Ten√£

I'm a Brazilian Web Developer, got introduced to coding at a young age, when I got the oportunity to try Python for the first time, loved rendering my first "Hello World!" in the console and since then I can't stop learning.
It's now not only a habit but also my mission, to code away all the ideas I have and to aquire as much knowledge I can from this always growing World Wide Web...
